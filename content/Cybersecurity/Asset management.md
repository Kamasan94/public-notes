**Asset management** is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. The idea behind this process is simple: you can only protect what you know you have

Keeping assets safe requires a workable system that helps businesses operate smoothly.

**Asset classification** is the practice of labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization

sensitivity and importance of an asset typically requires knowing the following:

- What you have
    
- Where it is
    
- Who owns it, and
    
- How important it is

### Common asset classifications

- **Restricted** is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets,  like need-to-know information.
    
- **Confidential** refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization.
    
- **Internal-only** describes assets that are available to employees and business partners.
    
- **Public** is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they’re released.
