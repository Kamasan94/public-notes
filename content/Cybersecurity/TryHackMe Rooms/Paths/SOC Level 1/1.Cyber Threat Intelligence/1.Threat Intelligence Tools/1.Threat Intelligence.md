### Threat Intelligence Classification

- **Strategic Intel:** High-level intel that looks into the organization's threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.
- **Technical Intel:** Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyze and develop defense mechanisms.
- **Tactical Intel:** Assesses adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.
- **Operational Intel:** Looks into an adversary's specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes, and technologies) that may be targeted.
