Another open-sourced platform designed to provide organisations with the means to manage CTI through the storage, analysis, visualisation and presentation of threat campaigns, malware and IOCs.

### Objective
Developed by the collaboration of the [French National cybersecurity agency (ANSSI)](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/), the platform's main objective is to create a comprehensive tool that allows users to capitalise on technical and non-technical information while developing relationships between each piece of information and its primary source.

### OpenCTI Data Model
The main one being the Structured Threat Information Expression ([STIX2](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro)) standards.
STIX is a serialised and standardised language format

- **GraphQL API:** The API connects clients to the database and the messaging system.
- **Write workers:** Python processes utilised to write queries asynchronously from the RabbitMQ messaging system.
- **Connectors:** Another set of Python processes used to ingest, enrich or export data on the platform. These connectors provide the application with a robust network of integrated systems and frameworks to create threat intelligence relations and allow users to improve their defence tactics.
#### Connectors
|Class|Description|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|**External Input Connector**|Ingests information from external sources|CVE, MISP, TheHive, MITRE|
|**Stream Connector**|Consumes platform data stream|History, Tanium|
|**Internal Enrichment Connector**|Takes in new OpenCTI entities from user requests|Observables enrichment|
|**Internal Import File Connector**|Extracts information from uploaded reports|PDFs, STIX2 Import|
|**Internal Export File Connector**|Exports information from OpenCTI into different file formats|CSV, STIX2 export, PDF|
