Every Yara command requires two arguments to be valid:
- The rule file we create
- Name of file, directory, or process ID to use the rule for

`touch myfirstrule.yar`

```yaml
rule examplerule {
        condition: true
}
```

`yara myfirstrule.yar somefile`

### Conditions
https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html

#### Meta
Reserved for descriptive information

#### Strings
To search for specific text or hexadecimal 

Essentially, if any file has the string "Hello World!" then the rule will match. 
```yaml
rule helloworld_checker{
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"
		
	condition:
		$hello_world
		
}
```

`any of them` as condition allows multiple strings to be searched for

<= less than or equal to
>= more than or equal to
!= not equal to

and
not
or
