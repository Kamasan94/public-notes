Powerful as high-level languages and allows us to investigate and correlate the detected events.

|---|---|
|Zeek has base scripts installed by default, and these are not intended to be modified.|These scripts are located in "/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base".|
|User-generated or modified scripts should be located in a specific path.|These scripts are located in  <br>**"/opt/zeek/share/zeek/site".**|
|Policy scripts are located in a specific path.|These scripts are located in **"/opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy"**.|
|Like Snort, to automatically load/use a script in live sniffing mode, you must identify the script in the Zeek configuration file. You can also use a script for a single run, just like the signatures.|The configuration file is located in "/opt/zeek/share/zeek/site/local.zeek".|
### Example
```
event dhcp_message (c: connection, is_orig: bool, msg: DHCP::Msg, options: DHCP::Options) 
{ 
	print options$host_name; 
}
```

`zeek -C -r smallFlows.pcap dhcp-hostname.zeek`


**Investigate the dhcp.log file. What is the identified domain value?**
jaalam.net

**Investigate the bigFlows.pcap file. Investigate the dhcp.log file. What is the number of identified unique hostnames?**
`cat dhcp.log | zeek-cut host_name | sort -nr | uniq`
