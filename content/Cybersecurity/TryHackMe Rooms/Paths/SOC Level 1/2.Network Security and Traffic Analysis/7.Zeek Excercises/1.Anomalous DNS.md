**Investigate the dns-tunneling.pcap file. Investigate the dns.log file. What is the number of DNS records linked to the IPv6 address?**
`cat dns.log | zeek-cut qtype_name | grep AAAA | wc -l`

**Investigate the conn.log file. What is the longest connection duration?**
`cat conn.log | zeek-cut duration | sort`

**Investigate the dns.log file. Filter all unique DNS queries. What is the number of unique domain queries?**
`cat dns.log | zeek-cut qtype | sort -r | uniq | wc -l`

**There are a massive amount of DNS queries sent to the same domain. This is abnormal. Let's find out which hosts are involved in this activity. Investigate the conn.log file. What is the IP address of the source host?**
