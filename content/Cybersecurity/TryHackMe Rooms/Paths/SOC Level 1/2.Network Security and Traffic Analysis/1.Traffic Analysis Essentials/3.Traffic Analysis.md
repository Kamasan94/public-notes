### Traffic Analysis / Network Traffic Analysis

Traffic Analysis is a method of intercepting, recording/monitoring, and analysing network data and communication patterns to detect and respond to system health issues, network anomalies, and threats.

Two main techniques

|**Flow Analysis**|**Packet Analysis**|
|Collecting data/evidence from the networking devices. This type of analysis aims to provide statistical results through the data summary without applying in-depth packet-level investigation.<br><br>- **Advantage:** Easy to collect and analyse.<br>- **Challenge:** Doesn't provide full packet details to get the root cause of a case.|Collecting all available network data. Applying in-depth packet-level investigation (often called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) ) to detect and block anomalous and malicious packets.<br><br>- **Advantage:** Provides full packet details to get the root cause of a case.<br>- **Challenge:** Requires time and skillset to analyse.|
