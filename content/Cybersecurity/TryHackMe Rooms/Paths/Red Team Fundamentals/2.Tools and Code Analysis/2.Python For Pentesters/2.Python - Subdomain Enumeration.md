Finding subdomains used by the target organization is an effective way to increase the attack surface and discover more vulnerabilities

```python
import requests
import sys

sub_list = open("subdomain.txt").read()
subdoms = sub_list.splitlines()

for sub in subdoms:
	sub_domains = f"http://{sub}.{sys.argv[1]}"

	try:
		requests.get(sub_domains)

	except requests.ConnectionError:
		pass
	else:
		print("Valid domain: ", sub_domain)
```
