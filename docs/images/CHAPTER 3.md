- The CompTIA A+ 1101 exam objectives spell out the original (now unused) acronym for ARM, Advanced RISC Machine (ARM)

- The CompTIA A+ 1101 exam objectives reverse the numbers for x86-64, so you’ll see them as x64/x86. Or perhaps that’s meant to be shorthand for x64 vs. x86. You know the distinctions, so you won’t miss anything on the exam.

- The primary benefit of 64-bit computing is to support more than 4 GB of memory, the limit with 32-bit processing.

- Typically, the CompTIA A+ exams expect you to know that L1 cache will be the smallest and fastest cache; L2 will be bigger and slower than L1; and L3 will be the biggest and slowest cache. (This is not completely true anymore, with L1 and L2 running the same speed in many CPU's, but it is how it will appear on the exams.)

- A heat sink by itself (no fan) on a chip provides passive cooling. A heat sink and fan combination provides active cooling. You’ll sometimes hear the latter described as an active heat sink

- 

	1. Too much thermal paste can impede the flow of heat from the CPU to the heat sink and cause the CPU to heat up rapidly. All modern CPUs have built-in failsafes that tell them to shut down before getting damaged by heat. 

	2. Not enough thermal paste or thermal paste spread unevenly can cause the CPU to heat up and consequently shut itself down. 

	3. Failure to connect the fan power to the motherboard can cause the CPU to heat up and shut itself down

- CompTIA calls the BSoD and pinwheel proprietary crash screens
