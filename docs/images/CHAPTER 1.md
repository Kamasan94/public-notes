- Static electricity, and therefore the risk of ESD (Electro-Static Discharge), is much more prevalent in dry, cool environments

- Always put components in an anti-static bag, not on the bag

- Always disconnect power before repairing a personal computing device

- When you build out a computer space, such as a server closet (the room that has a lot of important computers in it), use standard carpentry safety techniques. Wear an air filter mask, when cutting drywall, for example. Wear safety goggles when using power tools

- The CompTIA A+ certification exams assume that all techs should back up systems every time before working on them, even though thatâ€™s not how it works in the real world.
